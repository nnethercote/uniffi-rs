///   * You must keep the argument buffer alive for the duration of the call,
///     and avoid mutating it e.g. from other threads.
///   * You must eventually free the return value by passing it to the string
///     destructor defined below. Not just "a string destructor like the one
///     defined below", the very one defined below for this component!
///
/// This function will report a panic via its `ExternError` out arg if given
/// a null or invalid pointer, or a buffer containing non-utf8 bytes.
